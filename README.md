# Tutorials for the Cold Spring Harbor Asia & NYU-Shanghai Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Summer School 2018 (CCNSS 2018)
http://www.ccnss.org/ccn-2018

Python teaching material and tutorials for 40+ Ph.D. students (approx. 16+ hours of tutorials). 

Topics covered: Optimisation, Model fitting, Model comparison, Signal Detection Theory, Drift Diffusion Modelling, Bayesian models of cognition, Computational Psychiatry, etc.

All tutorials include solutions (just run the cells with the `hide_toggle(for_next=True)` code, and click on the link `Show\hide Solution below`)

Sometimes the notebook viewer does not load the iPython notebooks in GitHub, if so, click on the links below such that the notebooks open in notebookviewer instead.

* Tutorial 1: Signal detection theory, drift diffusion modelling

* Tutorial 2: Model fitting (grid search, gradient methods, least squares), Model comparison

* Tutorial 3: Data wrangling, conjugate probabilistic models, parameter recovery, posterior predictive fits

* Tutorial 4: Computational psychiatry
